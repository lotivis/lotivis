## Installing

If you use npm, `npm install lotivis`. You can also download the [latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/lotivis/lotivis/releases/latest). For vanilla HTML in modern browsers, import lotivis from Skypack:

```html
<script type="module">

import * as lotivis from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/lotivis@1";

const barChart = lotivis.bar();

</script>
```

For legacy environments, you can load lotivisâ€™s UMD bundle from an npm-based CDN such as jsDelivr; a `lotivis` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lotivis@1"></script>
<script>

const barChart = lotivis.bar();

</script>
```

You can also use the standalone lotivis microlibraries. For example, [lotivis-data](https://github.com/lotivis/lotivis-data):

```html
<script type="module">

import { DataController } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/lotivis-data@1";

const data = [/* */]
const dc = new DataController(data);

</script>
```
